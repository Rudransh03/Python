If N node the N-1 edges

types of tree
1) General tree : No restriction on number of children.
2) Binary tree: Every node can have atmost two children.
   1) Full Binary tree : every node can have either 0 or 2 children
   2) Complete Binary tree : all levels except last level 
      should be completely filled left to right
   3) perfect Binary tree : internal nodes contain two children, all leaf nodes 
      present at same level
   4) Balanced Binary tree : Check absolute dif of left and right sub tree, if its 
      less or equal to 1, then its BB tree.
   5) Pathological Binary tree : every parent tree node has one child node
